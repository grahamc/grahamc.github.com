Repair manual: [http://topics-cdn.dell.com/pdf/xps-15-9560-laptop_setup%20guide_en-us.pdf](http://topics-cdn.dell.com/pdf/xps-15-9560-laptop_setup%20guide_en-us.pdf)

I have:

```
Product Name: XPS 15 9560
System BIOS: 1.0.3
ePSA: Build 4304.17 UEFI ROM
```

## Initial Setup
### Make a USB recovery disk for windows

You need a 16gb flash drive, and it will use the whole drive. Search
Windows for "recovery" and it should recommend "Create a recovery
drive" or something.

Make a note on the drive, store it for later. Just in case.

Also write the installer image to a USB disk ask described in the
instructions:
[https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-uefi-installation](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-uefi-installation)

Plug in your USB disk before rebooting to the BIOS.

### Reboot to the BIOS

Pressing F2 when the DELL logo appears on the screen (repair manual,
page 96) takes you to the BIOS.

Pressing F2 _before_ the DELL logo appears enters you in to a
Diagnostic Boot.

Note: You don't need to press "Fn" with "F2" to enter setup.

You can navigate the BIOS with the arrow keys, or mouse, or touch
screen.

#### Disable Secure Boot

Navigate to Secure boot -> Secure Boot Enable, select Disabled.

In General -> Boot Sequence, you should see in the top right "Windows
Boot Manager" and an entry for your USB drive, "UEFI: ...". Select the
Windows Boot Manager by tapping on it or with the mouse, then using
the arrow icons to right move it to the bottom of the priority list.

When I did this, I also inserted my Windows Recovery USB and made it
the highest priority. This way, I can check the disk is good, reboot,
unplug, and move on to the NixOS without going back in to the BIOS.

This seemed to only make the change for a single boot. I also always
saved these as User Custom Settings or whatever the option is. I'm not
sure what that means, but I did it.

#### Disable RAID mode

System Configuration -> SATA Operation -> Select AHCI.

In RAID mode, Linux doesn't seem to pick them up. I'm not sure why it
is in RAID mode to begin with. If you want to dig in to this, the
hardware reported here as Intel 82801 SATA in RAID mode.

#### Optional: Enable USB Wake Support

Power Management -> USB Wake Support -> Enable USB Wake Support

#### Interesting Features

 - System Configuration -> USB PowerShare
 - Security -> Various password settings (including Strong Password
   and Password Bypass)
 - Security -> TPM 2.0 Security
 - Intel Software Guard Extensions
 - C-States Control?
 - Turboboost?
 - MEBx Hotkey

According to Security -> OROM Keyboard Access, you can press:

 - Ctrl-1 to access Intel RAID config
 - Crll-P/F12 to access Intel Management Engine BIOS Extension


## Reboot in to the NixOS Installer

I reboot and there it is, loaded, the beautiful (lol) systemd-boot.
The text is very small. God help our eyes.

At the boot menu, I selected the default, "NixOS Live CD". It worked
perfectly. I also tried the "NixOS Live CD (with nomodeset)" and it
seemed to work just the same. I continued on with "NixOS Live CD".

#### Resolution....

I tried pressing `e` to edit boot options and set the screen to a
lower resolution with `vga` and `video`, but none of them worked. One
point for debugging is I see in the journal:

```text
fb0: EFI VGA frame buffer device
```

and if I looked at `/sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes` I only saw one mode:

```text
3840x2160p-87
```

Windows reports a resolution of 3840x2160, but scaled 250%.

After you boot, you can type `setfont latarcyrheb-sun32` and get a
slightly larger font. (Found:
[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Linux_console](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Linux_console))

#### Wifi

Works out of the box! Yay! Uses an Atheros driver (model QCA6174)

can be setup with:


```text
wpa_supplicant -D nl80211,ext -i wlp2s0 -c <(wpa_passphrase YourWififNetwork "YourWifiPassword")
```

After connecting, Fn-Alt-F2 to change to TTY2 for the rest of the
work. (Fix the font there, too.)

This was extremely helpful: [https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/13342#issuecomment-301451545](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/13342#issuecomment-301451545)

#### Disks

If you don't have devices at `/dev/nvme_*` you forgot to turn off RAID
mode, or you're on your own...

You'll want to use `gdisk` on `/dev/nvme0n1`, I found this via `lsblk`,
as according to the UEFI instructions in the manual.

I then deleted partitions 2 through 6, leaving only 500M EFI system
partition, and created partitions so it looked like:

| Partition | Size                  | Code   | Purpose                  |
|-----------+-----------------------+--------+--------------------------|
|         1 | 500 MiB               | `EF00` | EFI partition            |
|         2 | 3 MiB                 | `8300` | cryptsetup luks key      |
|         3 | 16 GiB                | `8300` | swap space (hibernation) |
|         4 | remaining (460.4 GiB) | `8300` | root filesystem          |

Note I use `8300` as the code because they're all encrypted. Calling
the swap partition swap, systemd will try to automatically use it.

Then:

```text
# Create an encrypted disk to hold our key, the key to this drive
# is what you'll type in to unlock the rest of your drives... so,
# remember it:
$ cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2
$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptkey

# Fill our key disk with random data, wihch will be our key:
$ dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/mapper/cryptkey bs=1024 count=14000

# Use the encrypted key to create our encrypted swap:
$ cryptsetup luksFormat --key-file=/dev/mapper/cryptkey /dev/nvme0n1p3

# Create an encrypted root with a key you can remember.
$ cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p4
# Now add the cryptkey as a decryption key to the root partition, this
# way you can only decrypt the cryptkey on startup, and use the
# cryptkey to decrypt the root.
#
# The first human-rememberable key we added is just in case.
$ cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/nvme0n1p4 /dev/mapper/cryptkey

# Now we open the swap and the root and make some filesystems.
$ cryptsetup luksOpen --key-file=/dev/mapper/cryptkey /dev/nvme0n1p3 cryptswap
$ mkswap /dev/mapper/cryptswap

$ cryptsetup luksOpen --key-file=/dev/mapper/cryptkey /dev/nvme0n1p4 cryptroot
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/cryptroot

# and rebuild the boot partition:
$ mkfs.vfat /dev/nvme0n1p1
```

Then for a not fun bit, matching entries in `/dev/disk/by-uuid/` to
the partitions we want to mount where. Running `ls -l
/dev/disk/by-uuid/` shows which devices have which UUIDs. To determine
what `dm-1` and `dm2`, I ran `ls -la /dev/mapper`:

| name                                   | symlink to  | note                |
|----------------------------------------+-------------+---------------------|
| `1234-5678`                            | `sda2`      | installer           |
| `1970-01-01-00-00-01-00`               | `sda1`      | installer           |
| `AAAA-AAAA`                            | `nvme0n1p1` | /boot               |
| `BBBBBBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBBBBBBBBBB` | `nvme0n1p2` | encrypted cryptkey  |
| `CCCCCCCC-CCCC-CCCC-CCCC-CCCCCCCCCCCC` | `nvme0n1p3` | encrypted cryptswap |
| `DDDDDDDD-DDDD-DDDD-DDDD-DDDDDDDDDDDD` | `nvme0n1p4` | encrypted cryptroot |
| `EEEEEEEE-EEEE-EEEE-EEEE-EEEEEEEEEEEE` | `dm-1`      | decrypted cryptswap |
| `FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF` | `dm-2`      | decrypted cryptroot |

Note I do have a `dm-0` for `cryptkey`, but no UUID but we won't need
it. I substituted the actual hash with `A` s `B` s `C` s `D` s `E` s and
`F` s in order to make the mount commands easier.

```text
# Enable swap using the decrypted cryptswap:
$ swapon /dev/disk/by-uuid/EEEEEEEE-EEEE-EEEE-EEEE-EEEEEEEEEEEE

# Mount the decrypted cryptroot to /mnt
$ mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF /mnt

# Setup and mount the boot partition
$ mkdir /mnt/boot
$ mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/AAAA-AAAA /mnt/boot
```

### Initial Configuration

Run `nixos-generate-config --root /mnt`

#### `hardware-configuration.nix` changes

I had to edit the `hardware-configuration.nix` to setup the luks
configuration. I did this with `nix-shell -p emacs`, deleted the
`boot.initrd.luks.devices` line, and added:

```nix
{
  # !!! cryptkey must be done first, and the list seems to be
  # alphabetically sorted, so take care that cryptroot / cryptswap,
  # whatever you name them, come after cryptkey.
  boot.initrd.luks.devices = {
    cryptkey = {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/BBBBBBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBBBBBBBBBB";
    };

    cryptroot = {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/DDDDDDDD-DDDD-DDDD-DDDD-DDDDDDDDDDDD";
      keyFile = "/dev/mapper/cryptkey";
    };

    cryptswap = {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/CCCCCCCC-CCCC-CCCC-CCCC-CCCCCCCCCCCC";
      keyFile = "/dev/mapper/cryptkey";
    };
  };
}
```

It should already be correct, but check that:

1. `swapDevices` refers to
   `/dev/disk/by-uuid/EEEEEEEE-EEEE-EEEE-EEEE-EEEEEEEEEEEE`
2. `fileSystems."/boot".device` refers to
   `/dev/disk/by-uuid/AAAA-AAAA`
3. `fileSystems."/".device` refers to
   `/dev/disk/by-uuid/FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF`

#### `configuration.nix` changes

The generated `configuration.nix` seemed correct, too, but I made some
changes:

```nix
{
  # I set the boot.kernelPackages to linuxPackages_latest just out of
  # habit, since I'm a power-user I'd rather detect problems before
  # other users.
  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_latest;

  # I like networkmanager over wpa_supplicant, and with networkmanager
  # you don't need to enable networking.wireless. You _do_ need to
  # enable one of them, or you'll not have wifi when you boot back up.
  networking.networkmanager.enable = true;

  i18n.consoleFont = "latarcyrheb-sun32";

  # See the cpufreq section below
  powerManagement.cpuFreqGovernor = "powersave";

  services.xserver = {
    enable = true;
    # Note I didn't set autorun to be true until I figured out the
    # monitorSection / went through the "X Server Resolution" process
    # below, because the xserver display was much too small. I set it
    # to true after I had sorted out the DPI.
    autorun = true;

    # libinput performs better for me than synaptics:
    libinput.enable = true;

    # Just my personal preference:
    displayManager.lightdm.enable = true;
    windowManager.i3.enable = true;

    monitorSection = ''
      DisplaySize 406 228
    '';
  };
}
```

I did not set `users.mutableUsers` to `false` yet, or create my own
user. I usually do this once I get to a GUI so I can set
`hashedPassword`.

#### X Server Resolution

Note that when testing this, I would:

1. run `systemctl start display-manager` to start it
2. Press escape to exit the i3 configurator
3. press Alt-Enter to get a terminal
4. run `systemctl stop display-manager` to stop X
5. type Fn-Alt-F1 to get back to my terminal

`xdpyinfo | grep -B2 resolution` (installed with `nix-shell -p
xorg.xdpyinfo`) revealed:

```text
screen #0:
 dimensions:  3840x2160 pixels (1016x571 millimeters)
 resolution:  96x96 dots per inch
```

##### Successfully raised the resolution:

I took the 1016x571 and divided by 2.5, based on the 250% scaling I
saw in the Windows settings, and using
[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg#Display_size_and_DPI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg#Display_size_and_DPI), came
up with:

```nix
{
  services.xserver.monitorSection = ''
    DisplaySize 406 228
  '';
}
```

however when I started a terminal in i3, it was still tiny. Adding
`terminator` to `systemPackages` seemed to scale correctly. Note: on
my other High-DPI computer, I never fixed xterm and it never seemed to
matter.

##### Failed to fix the resolution:
```nix
{
  services.xserver.screenSection = ''
    Option "DPI" "240 x 240"
  '';
}
```

##### Fixed the resolution, but was super fuzzy:

On startup, running `xrandr --output eDP1 --scale 0.4x0.4` (0.4 being
1 divided by 2.5)
### Install...

NOTE: If you use `nix-shell` you must not run `nixos-install` inside
the `nix-shell`!

I ran `nixos-install`, rebooted, and it worked like a charm.

Boots fine!

### Hardware Check

#### Battery sensor worked out of the box
#### Webcam looks up your nose, but worked fine out of the box.
#### Backlight (intel) works out of the box

```text
$ cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness
187

$ echo "100" | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness

$ nix-shell -p xorg.xbacklight --run "xbacklight -set 50"
```

See: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight)

#### Audio works out of the box, including headphone switching

Volume control: `alsamixer` works out of the box, using Master /
Headphone / Speaker mixers.

#### Suspend

`systemctl suspend` suspects correctly, and pressing the mouse button
resumes correctly.

#### Hibernate
`systemctl hibernate` great if you have swap.

#### Trackpad

Using `services.xserver.libinput.enable = true;` fixes all these
problems, and the touch screen continue to work. Right click by
clicking in the bottom right corner.

Notes from before:

It works, but it seems to be in absolute positioning mode, and right
click seems to not work.

```text
psmouse serio1: synaptics: device claims to have extended capability 0x0c, but I'm not able to read it.

### BIOS Upgrades Without Windows

1. Make sure you're on AC power. NOT the optional battery pack! It
   will not boot to USB on the battery pack.
2. `nix-shell -p gparted -p unetbootin`
3. run `sudo gparted` a format your USB disk to have one partition,
   FAT32, with the boot flag. After, right click and Format the
   partition as fat32.
4. Mount your USB disk (mine was at `/dev/sda1`) to `/mnt`
5. Run `sudo unetbootin`
6. Select FreeDOS 1.0 from the menu
7. Make sure the `USB Drive` `Type` is selected, and select the USB
   drive (again, mine was `/dev/sda1`) Then press OK
8. Download your BIOS update from Dell, and copy it to `/mnt/`.
9. Reboot to the BIOS setup
10. under Boot Options change `UEFI` to `Legacy` and make sure the
    boot devices above included at least USB.
11. **Prepare to stick around for the next 4 steps! Don't look away!
    FreeDOS's default option is install to the hard disk! It may be
    fine, but I've never tried it.**
12. Save and quit with the USB device plugged in.
13. Select the only boot option
14. Then select the "safe mode" option that says it won't load
    drivers.
15. Type `C:<enter>` then `dir<enter>` and type `XPS<tab>` to
    auto-select the XPS BIOS update and press Enter.
16. The update will prompt for `y` a few times. Once it is done, enter
    the BIOS again.
17. Verify the update took place
18. Disable the legacy boot, switching back to UEFI.

### Things to look in to...
#### Touch screen
 - Touch screen works out of the box (WHAT!)
 - doesn't scroll?
 - any touch is a click

In `/proc/bus/input/devices` the touchscreen is labeled:

```text
I: Bus=0003 Vendor=04f3 Product=24a0 Version=0110
N: Name="ELAN Touchscreen"
P: Phys=usb-0000:00:14.0-9/input0
S: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-9/1-9:1.0/0003:04F3:24A0.0001/input/input11

B: EV=2
B: KEY=400 0 0 0 0 0
B: ABS=3273800000000003 (may be wrong number of 0's?)
```

Running `cat /dev/input/event6` revealed lots of output when I touched
the screen.

Under `xinput` it is `id=12`. `xinput list-props 12` revealed more
information.

#### VGA Switcheroo

Unable to enable Bumblebee, because I'm using the latest linux kernel
and the nvidia driver doesn't compile with it yet.

#### mce hardware error

```text

Some reports of these here:
[http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/f/4613/t/19997490](http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/f/4613/t/19997490)

Using `mcelog` (`nix-shell -p mcelog`) it shows some output, but
requires an update. Our `mcelog` is out of date. I updated it in
unstable, and created an `mcelog` service. Nothing too scary in the
log, not sure what it is.

    See: [https://github.com/andikleen/mcelog/blob/master/mcelog.service](https://github.com/andikleen/mcelog/blob/master/mcelog.service)

#### `int3403 thermal: probe of INT3403:06 failed with error -22`


#### Other Notes
 - In the console, closing the lid causes it to go to sleep in some
   fashion, but opening the lid again doesn't get the screen back.
 - In X with no extra configuration, closing the lid and opening it
   sleeps and then restores the display correctly.


### Non-Problems
#### What are "Dell DMI hotkeys"?
