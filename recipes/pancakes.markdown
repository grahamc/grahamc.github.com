### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1 or 2 eggs
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted

### Directions
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.

Whisk egg whites if you want? Fold them in.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
